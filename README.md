Title of the Project - Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

Description - I have created an interactive Student Enrollment Form which implements CRUD operations using 
the tech stacks :- 
                    * HTML
                    * JavaScript
                    * Bootstrap
                    * JQuery
                    * JsonPowerDB 

This micro project is backed with JsonPowerDB DataBase Server. Here, I established 2 way communication 
i.e fetching data from database as well as sending data to the database can be performed.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB - 
* It provides live working HTML Templates.
* Pluggable and user defined API.
* Minimizes the complexity of interoperability of different applications.
* Minimizes the total cost of ownership.

Release History - First release - 13/12/2023

Table of contents- 
                Index.html file is the main html file.
                Index.js is the javascript file with all the logics.    
Illustrations - 
                Download the files to your local storage and execute index.html file using netbeans to get an interactive experience.
                
Scope of functionalities - 
                Using the form, we can enter the data of various students we want which will be saved to remote database.
                I have implemented data validation feature. According to this, student data can't be submitted partially 
                filled and an alert message will be shown in such case.
                Also, previously availabe data can be accessed by entering just the primary key. And changes can be made to the fetched data.
                
Project status - Ready for deployment.
